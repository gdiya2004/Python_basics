# ml:
# supervised learning:learning by us
# unsupervised learning:learning by itself,will see similar pattern in input
# reinforcement learning:rewrd/punishment basis:autonomous navigation in tesla
# semi-supervised learning
# data preprocessing
# regression
# classification
# trained:if accuracy is good
# over-fitting:kuch bhi function lga diya
# under-fitting:not trained properly
# appropriate fitting
# labels: labels are to be things to be predicted
# features:
# trained:train hoga
# test:test accuracy
# data mein noise means bekar ka input
# features ke andr relation find krna hota hai
# non-null value
# normal distribution
# skewed distribution:
# all data is converted into numeric form even images
# df.keys()
# df.info()
# df.describe()
# df.isnull().sum(): gives value 0 means no null type
# final_df:merge the 2 diff data types
